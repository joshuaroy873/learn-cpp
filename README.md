Repo containing non-AI Vim-typed C++ code written to solve practice problems to refresh CPP.

*Reason*: While solving Leetcode problems, I noticed myself googling syntaxes so much that it wasn't improving my coding skills.

`buildCpp.sh` automates building, execution and deleting execulable for cpp files.
- Usage: Run `./buildCpp.sh <source-file.cpp>` to compile, execute, and automatically remove the generated executable.
- Make `buildCpp.sh` executable the first time with `chmod +x buildCpp.sh`.

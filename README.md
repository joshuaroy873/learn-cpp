Repo containing non-AI, vim-typed C++ code written to solve practice problems in [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/cpp-exercises/) to refresh CPP.

*Reason*: While solving Leetcode problems, I noticed myself googling syntaxes so much that it wasn't improving my coding skills.

Planning to do the following next in this repo:
- Leetcode problems
- C language practice problems

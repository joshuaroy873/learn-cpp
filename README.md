Repo containing C++ code written to solve competitive programming problems.

`buildCpp.sh` automates building, execution and deleting execulable for cpp files.
- Usage: Run `./buildCpp.sh <source-file.cpp>` to compile, execute, and automatically remove the generated executable.
    - `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` usage incorporated: `-I` flag in `g++ -I. "$INPUT_FILE" -o "$EXECUTABLE_NAME"` adds pwd to search path.
- First time: Make `buildCpp.sh` executable with `chmod +x buildCpp.sh`.
